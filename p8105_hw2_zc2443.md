# Problem 1

## Question 1

``` r
trashwheel = read_excel("HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
                        range = "A2:N336", na = "") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  na.omit() %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls, 0)))
```

## Question 2

``` r
precip_2017 = read_excel("HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
                        range = "A2:B14", na = "") %>% 
  mutate(Year = 2017)

precip_2018 = read_excel("HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
                        range = "A2:B9", na = "") %>% 
  mutate(Year = 2018)

comb_precip = left_join(precip_2017, precip_2018, by = "Month") %>% 
  mutate(Month = month.name)
```

## Question 3

The trashwheel dataset has 285 observations and the comb\_precip has 12
observations. For the trashwheel dataset, variable sports ball is the
key variable; for the comb\_precip dataset, total number of
precipitation is the key variable. The total precipitation in 2018 is
25.49 in. The median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017 is 8
